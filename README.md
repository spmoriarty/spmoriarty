### About
My past experience in social work instilled an ethos of community and communication, and the need for both when interacting in a professional space. As I move into a career in full stack development, my motivation is to bring the experiences and challenges my clients had navigating their respective needs with my knowledge from the field into a space where technology can help meet those needs or adapt programs to do just that.
